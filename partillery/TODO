Issues
----------

1) When tank moves - the turret must be deleted before moving
2) Random init location of tank - must not fall outside or intersect with play window
3) Explosion, deletes tank too.
4) Explosion may partially fall outside the window - gives a rect error
6) grab combo eraser for tank whenever movement stops

Pending features
